# Introduction
Bear attacks are one of the scariest encounters for normal civilians, although the number of attacks comes to an average of 11 attacks per year in America it is still dangerously fatal. “Alaska has the highest number of bears of any state with 100,000 black bears, 30,000 grizzlies, and between 4,000 – and 7,000 polar bears.” The number of bears alone might not be high and the number of attacks is considered low compared to other animals. However, there are still families that have lost their loved ones due to these attacks, and many more were injured during their encounters. We wish to create a safer environment for both the animals and people, this can be achieved by warning people beforehand that the area they are entering is common with bears and could lead to potential encounters. 
 
We can determine the areas in which most attacks are bound to occur by reviewing past data and warning people about the locations with possible encounters with bears. We could also point out the most dangerous bears to encounter with the highest fatality rate so that we could warn people about the danger before anyone or any animal gets hurt due to the intrusion.
 
The need to create a safer environment for both humans and bears is pressing, which highlights the importance of our proposed project. Our mission is to implement measures that warn people in advance about entering areas that are prone to bear encounters. By analyzing past data on bear attacks, we aim to identify high-risk zones and alert individuals to the potential dangers they may face. Moreover, we aspire to determine the most hazardous bear species, those with the highest fatality rates, to provide targeted warnings and protect the lives of both humans and animals from any harm. The story we aim to tell revolves around the delicate balance between wildlife conservation and human safety, particularly in cases of bear attacks. Such incidents have severe consequences, not only for the victims but also for their families and communities.
 
We cannot ignore the tragic stories that have been shared. They serve as a stark reminder of the work that must be done to make things right. We are committed to making a difference and offering our help in any way we can. With this project, we hope to be a part of the solution and create a better future for all. Our goal is to leave the viewers with a sense of empowerment, equipped with knowledge about the potential risks of Bear Country, and with the necessary tools to navigate the area more safely by the end of the narrative.
 
Our project aims to make bear attack statistics more relatable and empathetic. We want to educate people about the risks of bear encounters and inspire them to take action toward a safer coexistence between humans and bears. Our narrative is not just about the threat of bear encounters, but also about the collective responsibility we have in preserving human lives and the wildlife that inhabits our wilderness.



# Conclusion / Summary Takeaways

Throughout our analysis of data gathered on bear fatalities, a line can be drawn towards the complex dynamics of interactions between bears and humans. It shows the importance of informed decision-making and precautionary measures that must be taken in regions with high rates of fatalities. By acknowledging these patterns and addressing them through proactive measures, we can walk towards a more safe and environment free of bear-related fatalities. 

Region Patterns of Bear Attacks: The data compiled highlights clear regional patterns related to bear attacks and fatalities. Through our analysis, we discovered that most deaths occur in the western part of North America, particularly in the northwest region of the continent. Alaska, Alberta, British Columbia, Montana, and Wyoming are hotspots for bear-related fatalities, which shows the prevalence of bear and human interaction in this area.              

Gender Disparities in Fatalies: Our data shows that there is a clear and notable gender disparity in bear-related fatalities. While it is shown that males and females are both at risk for encountering bear attacks, males are significantly more likely to die/encounter an attack. The data shows that out of the 18 regions recorded 10 of them recorded only male deaths, which emphasizes the vulnerability of males to such incidents.

Frequency of Bear Attacks for Regions: The frequency of bear attacks across regions varies significantly across them. In Canadian and Alaskan regions such as Alaska, Alberta, and British Columbia, they experience the highest frequency of bear attacks, which is evident by the number of reports in these areas. Conversely, in the middle regions of North America, more significantly in the United States, there are lower frequencies of bear attacks.           

Implications for Safety Measures:  These findings have significant implications for implementing safety measures and raising awareness in regard to bear attacks. Understanding how the distribution of bear attacks, demographic vulnerabilities, and the frequency of such patterns, can help to inform us where safety measures, should be targeted, in order to mitigate the risks and overall enhance the safety for both humans and bears.
